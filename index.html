          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:

          Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
          informal education. Formal education takes place in education and
          training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and
          objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
          regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and
          commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary
          school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
          alternative to formal education. It may be structured according to
          educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually
          takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based

          Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's
          perspective. Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and
          role of the teacher, for example, in the form of transmitting
          knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate
          manner. Student-centered definitions, on the other hand,
          outline education based on the student's experience in the learning
          process, for example, based on how education transforms and enriches
          their subsequent experience. However, conceptualizations.
